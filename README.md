# Comp330-CPD
## Week 1

The start of university, my team have decided on a game to start prototyping and all the modules have been introduced.

## Week 2

Introduced to Javascript don't really understand it but I will wait for the next lesson to see if it helps. Learnt about the 6502 and shown the wiki we need to start adding too, I will add 200 words on a different topic within the wiki everyday until its due. Started thinkiing of a research topic, maybe something to do with choices in digital games.

## Week 3

Trouble in the team, certain members are not willing to compromise. Presentations of the de - makes for the NES went well. The wiki is going really well, my plan of adding 200 words on different topics is working effectively. Still don't understand where to start with the Javascript game. Decided on my research topic; the influence decision trees have on the player.

## Week 4

The team has split because of different opinions in work ethic and we have to start on a new game. I had to ask Gareth how and where to start the Javascript game. I'm enjoying the NES assembly programming.

## Week 5

Started prototyping a new game. I've really struggled with this Javascript assignment, every time I look up the solution to a problem online it doesn't work in my project. I've done nothing for the NES game in ages but I have finnished the ethics form (with Rorys help) for the research proposal.

## Week 6

Studio practise week. I'm trying to get the Javascript game finished as well as the technical poster for the game.

## Week 7

I've stopped working on the Javascript game in order to work on the NES game that I haven't touched in weeks, eventhough the NES game is worth more (percentage wise) of its module. I've also had to start preparing a presentation about my research project that I haven't done work on for ages as well. Technical poster and Javascript game presentation went well considering I really struggled to do it.

## Week 8

Research presentations went well. I've had to stop working on the NES game and start working on my dissertation proposal so I can finish it in time for hand in.
