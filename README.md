# Comp330-CPD
## Week 1

The start of university, my team have decided on a game to start prototyping and all the modules have been introduced.

## Week 2

Introduced to Javascript don't really understand it but I will wait for the next lesson to see if it helps. Learnt about the 6502 and shown the wiki we need to start adding too, I will add 200 words on a different topic within the wiki everyday until its due. Started thinking of a research topic, maybe something to do with choices in digital games.

## Week 3

Trouble in the team, certain members are not willing to compromise. Presentations of the de - makes for the NES went well. The wiki is going really well, my plan of adding 200 words on different topics is working effectively. Still don't understand where to start with the Javascript game. Decided on my research topic; the influence decision trees have on the player.

## Week 4

The team has split because of different opinions in work ethic and we have to start on a new game. I had to ask Gareth how and where to start the Javascript game. I'm enjoying the NES assembly programming.

## Week 5

Started prototyping a new game. I've really struggled with this Javascript assignment, every time I look up the solution to a problem online it doesn't work in my project. I've done nothing for the NES game in ages but I have finished the ethics form (with Rorys help) for the research proposal.

## Week 6

Studio practise week. I'm trying to get the Javascript game finished as well as the technical poster for the game.

## Week 7

I've stopped working on the Javascript game in order to work on the NES game that I haven't touched in weeks, even though the NES game is worth more (percentage wise) of its module. I've also had to start preparing a presentation about my research project that I haven't done work on for ages as well. Technical poster and Javascript game presentation went well considering I really struggled to do it.

## Week 8

Research presentations went well. I've had to stop working on the NES game and start working on my dissertation proposal so I can finish it in time for hand in.

## Week 9

Stopped working on everything apart from dissertation proposal.

## Week 10

Spent the week only working on the dissertation proposal it's finished now though. Managed to do a bit of work on the group game for this sprint.

## Week 11

Data interpretation lecture with Al was really useful. I spent everyday in the studio from 9am to 8pm working on the group game putting the whole of the game UI and narrative in. The BA developers aren't showing up, more so than usual.

## Week 12

In the studio from 9am ubtil 8pm trying to get the game prototype finished. Still no sign of BA developers the game is really behind schedule with art/ animation/ design. None of the other members of the group know anything about the game anymore because of how much work I have been putting in. Loads of bugs have been found last minute becasue the game has not been playtested by anyone but me and I have too much work to doeverything by myself. I am amazingly stressed and frustrated with the lack of motivation with my team.
